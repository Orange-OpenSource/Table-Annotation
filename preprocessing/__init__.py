* Software description: TableAnnotation (a.k.a DAGOBAH) is a semantic annotation tool for tables leveraging three steps: 1) Table Preprocessing: a set of comprehensive heuristic to clean the table (e.g. fix encoding error), determine table orientation, data types of columns. 2) Entity Lookup: retrieve a number of entity candidates for mentions in the table, using an elastic search-based entity lookup. 3) Annotation: disambiguate retrieved entity candidates, select the most relevant entity for each mention. This consists of three tasks, namely Cell-Entity Annotation, Column-Type Annotation, Column-Pair Annotation.
